<h1>Movie App - NextJs & TypeScript</h1>
I offer a modern movie platform developed with TypeScript and Next.js. This site, which provides access to the most up-to-date movie information thanks to The Movie Database (TMDB) API, has been designed with every detail in mind with a user-friendly design.

There are three main categories on the home page: popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies. Movies are listed with a visual-first structure. When you hover over any movie, the movie's score, name, and release date are dynamically displayed.

When you click on any movie, you are directed to the detail page, and extended descriptions and high-quality images about the movie are presented to the user.

The advanced search bar allows users to quickly find the movies they are looking for according to the data received from TMDB.

With the support of Next Themes, which takes the user experience to the next level, the site offers both dark mode and light mode options. This feature can be changed instantly according to user preference.
